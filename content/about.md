Hello, I'm Thanh Nguyen from Vietnam, bringing over 5 years of extensive experience in software development. My expertise spans a diverse range of projects, including E-commerce, social networks, live streaming, and more. Additionally, I have actively learned and contributed to various blockchain and Web3-related initiatives, demonstrating a keen interest in cutting-edge technologies. Currently, I am deeply engaged in a real estate project that has been ongoing for nearly 2 and a half years. 

If your team is in search of a versatile professional with a wealth of solutions to offer, I am confident that my skills and experiences make me an ideal fit for your requirements.
